## Data
Data can be found
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data).
Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate
(FNA) of a breast mass. The first column us the patient ID, the second column
is the classification in diagnosis: M = malignant, B = benign, and the
remaining columns are real-valued features computed for each cell nucleus.

When we try to further zoom in the graph by removing 50 outliers (about 12% of
the original dataset), prVis shows a clearer distinction between red(malignant)
and black(benign), which may provides us the insight on what distinct them from
each other.
