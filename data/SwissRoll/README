Famous example for visual testing of dimensionality reduction
algorithms. A 4-component bivariate Gaussian mixture is generated,
creating a dataset with columns x and y.  Then a new dataset is
generated, with columns (x cos x, y, x sin x).  We then apply PCA and
various "nonlinear" alternatives, including umap and our prVis.


Sources of umap code:

1.  umapr, by @CivicAngela etc.

2.  umap, by Tomasz Konopka 

3.  uwot, by James Melville

The question is, Can we discern from the plots that originally we had a
4-component mixture?  So we first pretend we don't know this, and call
plot() without col = the original class labels.  We then add in the
labels to reveal how well the plots did.

sw <- read.table('Surendran.txt',header=T)
sw[,4] <- as.factor(sw[,4])

PCA is a failure, just displays a spiral swirl 

umap/umapr pkgs:

z <- umap(sw[,-4]) 
plot(z$layout)  # not clear, e.g. is upper-right a loop or sep. comp.?
plot(z$layout,col=sw[,4])  # ah, the latter

polyreg:

prVis(sw[,-4],labels=F)  # 4 concentric, tangential circles?
prVis(sw,labels=T)   # yes!
